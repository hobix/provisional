# Provisional

## Description

Provisional creates a new Rails project, using a standard Rails 2.3 application template, and checks it into a new SCM repository.

In the future, Provisional may be expanded to create production and staging environments, set up continuous integration, and automate other tasks that are usually performed at the beginning of a project.

## Requirements

Provisional requires Rails 2.3.0 or greater.

Provisional is only tested on Mac OS X. It should also work on Linux. It is not tested or supported on Windows.

## Installation

    sudo gem install provisional

## Usage

    Options:
          --name, -n <s>:   Name of the project
           --scm, -s <s>:   SCM to use (default: git)
      --template, -t <s>:   Rails template to use (default: viget)
        --domain, -d <s>:   Domain (for some SCMs, see below)
      --username, -u <s>:   Username (for some SCMs, see below)
      --password, -p <s>:   Password (for some SCMs, see below)
            --id, -i <s>:   Id (for some SCMs, see below)
        --config, -c <s>:   Config file (optional)
          --private, -r:   Private repository (for some SCMs, see documentation)
              --help, -h:   Show this message

All of these options can be specified either on the command line, or in a YAML file indicated by the --config option. The YAML file should be in simple key: value format:

    name: awesome_project
    scm: git

Options specified via the command line take precedence over options specified in a YAML file, if both are specified.

The SCM option can be one of the following ("`project_name`" refers to the value of the --name option):

* `git`: creates a Git repository in the `project_name` directory.
* `github`: creates a Git repository in the `project_name` directory, creates `project_name` on GitHub, adds it as the "origin" remote, and pushes. (See section below about required configuration.)
* `unfuddle`: creates a Git repository in the `project_name` directory, creates a repository called `project_name` under an existing Unfuddle project using the specified credentials, and adds it as the "origin" remote. _You must push manually_ because Unfuddle typically has a lag of a few minutes between when a repository is created and when it can be accessed. (See section below about required configuration.)
* `unfuddle_svn`: creates a Subversion repository called `project_name` under an existing Unfuddle project using the specified credentials, and checks it out into the `project_name` directory.
* `beanstalk`: creates a Subversion repository called `project_name` on Beanstalk using the specified credentials, and checks it out into the `project_name` directory.
* `heroku`: creates a Git repository in the `project_name` directory, creates an application called `project_name` on Heroku, adds it as the "heroku" remote, and pushes. (See section below about required configuration.)
* `hg`: creates a Mercurial repository in the `project_name` directory.
* `bzr`: creates a Bazaar repository in the `project_name` directory.

The domain, username, password, and id options are used by certain SCMs to provide information needed to use an API. The documentation on these SCMs (below) will indicate how they are to be used.

The template option can be either a literal path to a template file, a URL for a template on a remote server, or the name of one of the templates found in lib/provisional/templates (without the .rb suffix.) The default viget template does the following:

* freezes rails from currently installed gems
* installs gems: `mocha`, `factory_girl`, `shoulda`, `webrat`
* installs plugins: `hoptoad_notifier`, `jrails`, `model_generator_with_factories`, `viget_deployment`, `vl_cruise_control`, `asset_packager`
* installs a .gitignore file to ignore logs, temp files, sqlite3 databases, rcov reports, and `database.yml`
* generates Capistrano configuration with viget_deployment
* copies `database.yml` to `database.yml-sample`
* removes `public/index.html`, `test/fixtures`, prototype, and script.aculo.us
* creates an SCM repository and checks the application in

A few other templates are provided:

* The `braces` template installs an environment similar, but not exactly identical, to Thoughtbot's [Suspenders](http://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders) bootstrap.
* The `rspec_and_friends` template installs RSpec, Cucumber and Webrat.

## GitHub

To use [GitHub](http://github.com/), you will need to place your GitHub username and token in your Git configuration as [described here](http://github.com/guides/local-github-config). Since there is already this established convention for GitHub credentials, to prevent redundant configuration, Provisional does not use its own configuration options for GitHub access.

By default, repositories are publicly accessible. Use `--private` to make it private.

## Unfuddle

To use [Unfuddle](http://unfuddle.com/) (for either Git or Subversion) you will need to specify the --domain, --id, --username and --password options. --domain is used to specify your unfuddle.com subdomain; --id is used to specify a project ID. Using a YAML file containing these options is recommended and should be helpful.

## Beanstalk

As of this writing (May 2009) [Beanstalk](http://beanstalkapp.com/)'s API is in private beta. See [the API documentation](http://api.beanstalkapp.com/) for details on how to gain access. Thanks to Wildbit for giving us access to the private beta.

To use Beanstalk you will need to specify the --domain, ---username and --password options. --domain is used to specify your beanstalkapp.com subdomain. Using a YAML file containing these options is recommended and should be helpful.

## Heroku

To use [Heroku](http://heroku.com/), you will need to install the Heroku gem with `gem install heroku` and run its command-line tool to enter your Heroku username and password. Since there is already this established convention for Heroku credentials, to prevent redundant configuration, Provisional does not use its own configuration options for Heroku access.
